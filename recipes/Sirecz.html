    <h1>Sirecz (Easter Cheese)</h1>
    <img src="../images/sirecz-easter-cheese" alt="Sirecz (Easter Cheese)">
    <p>A traditional Slovak Easter Cheese served with the Easter meal. This is served sliced and cold. It tastes like a sweet custard.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>1 quart milk</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In an electric mixer, beat the eggs until mixed well.</li>
        <li>Transfer the eggs to a double boiler and stir in milk, sugar, vanilla and nutmeg. Cook over a medium heat for 30 minutes. Use a metal slotted spoon and constantly stir the bottom of the pan to prevent scorching.</li>
        <li>When the mixture looks just like cooked scrambled eggs, pour it carefully into a cheesecloth-lined colander. Carefully gather the ends of the cheesecloth in your hands and pull them together until the cheese forms into a ball. Tie the cheesecloth tightly at the top of the ball. Tie the cheesecloth ends over a faucet or to the handle of a kitchen cabinet (place a bowl under to catch the whey dripping down) and let hang for about 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Untie the cleesecloth and wrap the cheesecloth ball in plastic wrap before refrigerating. The cheese will keep for about a week. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
